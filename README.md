# Delivery-Time-Prediction

Predicting food delivery ETA is a fascinating and interesting challenge. It is important to be able to predict accurate delivery times to increase customer satisfaction and dynamically route employees in an optimal manner. If we quote the customer forty-five minutes for a delivery, we don’t want the delivery to be there at ninety minutes, but it also shouldn’t arrive at twenty minutes. Being spot-on is hard. There can be multiple factors which affect order delivery times including order characteristics, dasher characteristics & certain dynamic features such as traffic, busy mer- chants etc. Given a dataset of potential factors affecting the delivery time of food orders, we train a Machine Learning model which predicts the delivery time. We define a set of new historically aggregated features to input into the model. We experiment with various models such as Lin- ear Regression, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Regression(GBR) to model the training data. GBR outperforms other models and has superior bias/variance trade-off. Finally, we look at importance of various features and make recommendations to reduce the delivery time.
